# Neosoid
A heartbeat utility for NeosVR (or any other game/app that can read WebSockets).

## Supported services
Currently only Pulsoid and HypeRate are supported.  
If you know of another service and would like it to be supported don't hesitate to open an Issue about it.

>**Warning**  
> Neosoid uses the Pulsoid RPC to read data, which is not officially supported by the Pulsoid developers and may get you in trouble.  
> Using an account you do not care about is strongly recommended.

## How to use
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/JanoschABR/neosoid/wiki)
